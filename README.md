# Powerbi-Project
My Analysis was carried out using the Nestle sales performers  dataset.
Nestl√© is a leading company in nutrition, health and wellness and also the largest food company in the world, marketing over 8,500 brands and 30,000 products. It operates nearly 500 factories across 5 continents and employs over 200,000 employees worldwide. However, The company wants to expand its business which was important to know the performance of the current products.
I used Power BI for the entire process. The dataset was quite interesting to work with and I enjoyed the process.
